### Example `nginx.conf` with Comments

```nginx
# Global settings (Main context)
# These settings apply to the entire Nginx server.

# Specifies the user and group under which the worker processes run.
# Running as a non-root user (e.g., 'nginx') enhances security by limiting privileges.
user nginx;

# Sets the number of worker processes. 'auto' allows Nginx to detect the number of CPU cores
# and set the worker count accordingly. Each worker handles multiple connections.
worker_processes auto;

# Defines the path to the PID file, which stores the process ID of the master process.
# This file is used by management commands (e.g., 'nginx -s reload') to identify the process.
pid /var/run/nginx.pid;

# Events block: Configures how Nginx handles connections.
events {
    # Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections each worker process can handle.
    # Example: 4 workers with 1024 connections each = 4096 total connections.
    worker_connections 1024;
}

# HTTP block: Contains settings for handling HTTP traffic.
http {
    # Includes MIME types from an external file to map file extensions to content types.
    # Ensures proper Content-Type headers (e.g., 'text/html' for .html files).
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

    # Sets the default MIME type if no match is found in mime.types.
    # 'application/octet-stream' treats unmatched files as binary data.
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    # Defines a custom log format named 'main'. Logs details like client IP, request, status, etc.
    # Variables like $remote_addr and $request are placeholders for request-specific data.
    log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                    '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                    '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    # Specifies the path to the access log and uses the 'main' log format.
    # Records all successful requests for monitoring and debugging.
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;

    # Specifies the path to the error log for recording issues like 404s or server errors.
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

    # Enables the sendfile() system call for efficient file serving.
    # Reduces CPU overhead by letting the kernel handle file transfers directly.
    sendfile on;

    # Enables TCP_CORK to optimize network performance by reducing packet fragmentation.
    tcp_nopush on;

    # Enables TCP_NODELAY to reduce latency by sending smaller packets immediately.
    tcp_nodelay on;

    # Sets the timeout (in seconds) for keep-alive connections. Closes idle connections after this time.
    # Keep-alive improves performance by reusing connections for multiple requests.
    keepalive_timeout 65;

    # Increases the size of the hash table for MIME types, improving lookup efficiency.
    types_hash_max_size 2048;

    # Includes additional configuration files from the conf.d directory.
    # Useful for modularizing configs (e.g., one file per virtual server).
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;

    # Server block: Defines a virtual server (e.g., a website).
    server {
        # Specifies the port to listen on (80 is standard for HTTP).
        listen 80;

        # Defines the domain names this server responds to.
        # Matches requests for 'example.com' or 'www.example.com'.
        server_name example.com www.example.com;

        # Sets the root directory for serving files.
        # Example: 'example.com/index.html' serves '/var/www/html/index.html'.
        root /var/www/html;

        # Specifies default files to serve when a directory is requested.
        # Tries 'index.html' first, then 'index.htm'.
        index index.html index.htm;

        # Location block: Defines how to handle requests for the root path ('/').
        location / {
            # Tries to serve the requested file or directory; returns 404 if not found.
            # $uri is the requested path, $uri/ checks for a directory.
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
    }
}
```

### Detailed Explanation of Parameters

#### **Global Settings (Main Context)**
- **`user nginx;`**:  
  Defines the user (and optionally group) under which Nginx worker processes run. Using a non-root user like `nginx` minimizes security risks if the server is compromised.

- **`worker_processes auto;`**:  
  Sets the number of worker processes. The `auto` value matches the number of CPU cores, optimizing performance. Each worker handles multiple client connections.

- **`pid /var/run/nginx.pid;`**:  
  Specifies the location of the PID file, which stores the master process ID. This is used by commands like `nginx -s reload` or `systemctl` to manage the server.

#### **Events Block**
- **`worker_connections 1024;`**:  
  Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections per worker process. Total capacity is `worker_processes × worker_connections` (e.g., 4 × 1024 = 4096 connections).

#### **HTTP Block**
- **`include /etc/nginx/mime.types;`**:  
  Imports a file that maps file extensions to MIME types (e.g., `.html` to `text/html`), ensuring correct `Content-Type` headers for responses.

- **`default_type application/octet-stream;`**:  
  Defines the fallback MIME type for files not matched in `mime.types`. Treats unknown files as generic binary data.

- **`log_format main '...';`**:  
  Creates a custom log format named `main`. It logs variables like:
  - `$remote_addr`: Client IP address.
  - `$remote_user`: Authenticated user (if any).
  - `$time_local`: Timestamp of the request.
  - `$request`: HTTP request line (e.g., "GET / HTTP/1.1").
  - `$status`: Response status code (e.g., 200, 404).
  - `$body_bytes_sent`: Bytes sent in the response body.
  - `$http_referer`: Referring URL (if provided).
  - `$http_user_agent`: Client browser or tool.
  - `$http_x_forwarded_for`: Original client IP (if behind a proxy).

- **`access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;`**:  
  Logs all successful requests to the specified file using the `main` format. Useful for analytics and troubleshooting.

- **`error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;`**:  
  Records server errors (e.g., 404, 500) in the specified file. No severity level is specified here, so it logs all errors.

- **`sendfile on;`**:  
  Enables the `sendfile()` system call, improving file-serving efficiency by bypassing user-space buffers.

- **`tcp_nopush on;`**:  
  Activates `TCP_CORK`, which delays sending small packets to batch them, reducing network overhead.

- **`tcp_nodelay on;`**:  
  Enables `TCP_NODELAY`, sending packets immediately to reduce latency, especially for small requests.

- **`keepalive_timeout 65;`**:  
  Sets a 65-second timeout for keep-alive connections. This allows clients to reuse connections, reducing overhead for subsequent requests.

- **`types_hash_max_size 2048;`**:  
  Increases the hash table size for MIME types, speeding up lookups when serving many file types.

- **`include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;`**:  
  Imports additional configuration files from `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`, allowing modular setups (e.g., separate files for each site).

#### **Server Block**
- **`listen 80;`**:  
  Specifies that this server listens on port 80, the default for HTTP traffic.

- **`server_name example.com www.example.com;`**:  
  Defines the domain names this server handles. Requests to these domains match this block.

- **`root /var/www/html;`**:  
  Sets the document root. Files are served from this directory based on the request path.

- **`index index.html index.htm;`**:  
  Lists default files to serve when a directory is requested (e.g., `example.com/` serves `index.html`).

#### **Location Block**
- **`location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404; }`**:  
  Handles requests starting with `/` (all requests). The `try_files` directive:
  - Checks for a file at `$uri` (e.g., `/about.html`).
  - Checks for a directory at `$uri/` (e.g., `/blog/`).
  - Returns a 404 error if neither exists.

### How to Use This Configuration
1. **Customize**: Replace `server_name` with your domain (e.g., `mywebsite.com`) and `root` with your site’s file path.
2. **Install Nginx**: On Ubuntu, use `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx`.
3. **Update Config**: Place this in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` (back up the original first).
4. **Test**: Run `sudo nginx -t` to verify syntax.
5. **Apply**: Reload with `sudo nginx -s reload` or restart with `sudo systemctl restart nginx`.

This setup is a starting point for serving static content or proxying requests. You can extend it with SSL (`listen 443 ssl`), caching, or additional `server` blocks as needed. Let me know if you’d like deeper details on any part!
